I'm Beilong Tang, a senior Undergraduate student from [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/), majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences/Computer Science. I had strong background in machine learning, computer science, programming, and math. 

I'm current doing research on using Large Language Models to conduct Speech Separation under the supervision of [Prof. Ming Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C_JTsqgAAAAJ). Previously, I did research related to Federated Learning under the supervision of [Prof. Bing Luo](https://luobing1008.github.io/).
