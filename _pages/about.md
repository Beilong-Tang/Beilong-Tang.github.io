I am Beilong Tang, an incoming Ph.D. student of ECE at [North Carolina State University (NCSU)](https://ece.ncsu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Hamid Krim](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/ahk/) _(I want to express my sincere appreciation to [Dr. Vahid Tarokh](https://people.duke.edu/~vt45/) for his generous recommendation!)_. I will focus on diffusion models and other generative models. 

I graduated from [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/) May 2025 with _Signature Work with Distinction_ award and _Magna Cum Laude_ award, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences/Computer Science. For my undergraduate research, I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ming Li](https://sites.duke.edu/dkusmiip/) on using language models to conduct Target Speaker Extraction. Before that, I did research related to Federated Learning under the supervision of [Dr. Bing Luo](https://luobing1008.github.io/).


My research interests are in Deep Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, and Signal Processing.
