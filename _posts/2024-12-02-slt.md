I am very honored to attend [SLT 2024](https://2024.ieeeslt.org/) hosted in Macao. 

There are many fasinating works on discrete tokens. Keynote spekaer Prof. [Wenwu Wang](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/wenwu-wang) shared his research on 
[SemanticCodec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00233). It has a high accuracy on the first layer, making it potentially more suitable to various downstream decoder-only tasks where the autoregressive-model 
outputs the first layer only. 

My current reaserch bottleneck is how to reconstruct audios using discrete tokens from Kmeans on WavLM. I talked to one faculty and he gave me two papers to review: one is [BASE TTS: Lessons from building a billion-parameter text-to-speech model on 100K hours of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08093), and the other is [Towards Universal Speech Discrete Tokens: A Case Study for ASR and TTS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10447751). He stated that reconstructing audio with only Kmeans input is impossible because the discretization process losses too much speaker information. I should focus on using auxilary information to reconstruct speech in the next stage. I also attended the great talk on Personalzized Speech Enhancement by Prof. [Minje Kim](https://minjekim.com/) from UIUC. 

I also met the famous Professor [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) from National Taiwan University, and I took a photo with him.
